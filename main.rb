# Use gets.chomp to get input from users and puts for output
# Isolate your I/O logic to one or two classes. Don't allow all your classes to interact (gets/puts) with the User
# Remember to build incrementally, writing small amounts of runnable code instead of writing out a whole bunch of classes/methods that are not yet testable/runnable.
# Use puts, raise some_val.inspect, and byebug to help with debugging
